# Covid-19-data-analysis

### The goal of this project was to scrape COVID 19 data from this [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_cases) article that displays the cumulative montly case totals by country in 2020.

Once I scraped the table, I filtered it so I could save data specifically for the US and Latin American countries. My goal was to understand how Latin American countries were handling the pandemic compared to the US. In the wikipedia table there is a row that holds the total number of Covid-19 cases around the world. For each country, I calculated the percentage of Covid-19 cases compared to the cumulative montly cases in the world.

My future plans for this project include creating a dashboard using Flask that displays charts and filters for specific countries, and finding resources for 2021 and 2022 data to display in dashboard.
