# Covid-19-data-analysis

### The goal of this project was to scrape COVID 19 data from this [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_cases) article that displays the cumulative montly case totals by country in 2020.

Once I scraped the table, I filtered it so I could save data specifically for the US and Latin American countries. My goal was to understand how Latin American countries were handling the pandemic compared to the US.

My future plans for this project include creating a dashboard using Flask that displays charts and filters for specific countries. 

This is a [link](https://phase-1-covid-19.herokuapp.com/projects) to the current project.

You can access the api using the endpoint /api instead of projects.
